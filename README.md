# otp-generator
generates a random 4-digit OTP

Made using python, this program uses the 'random' and 'math' mmodules from Python, in order to fetch a randomised combination of 4-digit number, which can be used as an OTP(One Time Password)
Customisations can be made, as in input from the user, how many digit OTP they want, or whether they want alpha-numeric combinations, etc.
